## Then...

Towards the end of my PhD:

--

- While I loved science I wasn't sure about going straight into a postdoc

--

- Being curious about what other alternatives career I could do with my skills

## When my path deviated from (academic) linearity


üë©‚Äçüíª At the end of 2019 I joined the AI consulting company Melbourne based [Eliiza](https://eliiza.com.au/) and postponed my postdoc start

**Exposure to machine learning** in action & in production. 

**Working as a team**: I was never only by myself on a project - we needed to deliver a solution as a team, usually Data Scientist + ML Engineer

**Project management in consulting**: The work is planned from the beginning in a very structured way: with clear goals, actions and metrics

## But then..

I was missing the science

--

- I had an opportunity to change during mid 2020 (full pandemic) but my mental state was ü•¥

--

- Therefore I waited

--

- The opportunity came up again early 2021 where my mental state was instead üôÇ

## What I actually do every day 


üè°üíª **Work in a fun team**: Work with a fun interdisciplinary team of scientists, developers, marketing savvy.

üìô **Back to learning science**: Learn the intricacies of **mass spectrometry** (= most used technique to quantify proteins in a sample) & understand what life scientists need to transform their data into knowledge.

--

üë©‚Äçüíª **Develop in R & Python**: Assemble workflows in R to analyse mass spectrometry data.

--

üëê **Open Science**: Strive for reproducibility and open sourcing in what we produce.

--

üß† **Think of what's next**: As the science team, research, think and guide the development and use of data science in mass spectrometry.

## Some general reflections

--

- My pre-pandemic plans were very different to what actually happened but it still turned out ok for me

--

- I wouldn‚Äôt stress so much as I did in my last year of PhD about making the PERFECT decision for my future career as things just happened

--

- Opportunities might arise and you‚Äôre to ready or viceversa and that‚Äôs normal 


--

- Being part of a community (R-Ladies Melbourne) really helped to keep the connections also during the pandemic and feel less isolated

--

- Times have changed and it has been harder to actually meet and network with people. But you could:
  - Reach out and connect with someone after you‚Äôve met them at an event 
  - A few people reached out during over the lockdown to ask for career advice or general suggestions 

--

- Changing helped me became way more self-aware of what I actually enjoy
